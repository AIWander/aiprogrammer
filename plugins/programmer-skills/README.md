# programmer-skills (plugin profile)

Skill-only profile: the same six skills as the `programmer` profile with no
hook code of any kind. For hosts or users that do not want lifecycle hooks.

- `skills/` - programmer-getting-started, programmer-toolmap,
  programmer-dev-loop, programmer-background-ops, programmer-safe-ops,
  programmer-sessions (each with an `agents/openai.yaml` Codex adapter)
- `instructions/APPLY_TO_YOUR_AI.txt` - per-client activation guidance

Expects an existing `programmer` MCP connection
(`programmer.exe install --target <host>`). Install exactly one profile -
this one or `programmer`, not both.
